                    <p>
                        As I have lived in Ireland from the age of 5, I am fluent in the English. I can confidently say that I have a better command of the English language than the average person, as I am an avid reader of books and other materials which increase my command of the language.
                    </p> 
                <h4>Spanish:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Having been interested in learning the Spanish from a young age, I made the decision to learn Spanish from my first year of Secondary School. I continued learning the language until my Leaving Certificate exams. However, after this I stopped learning Spanish and as such, I lost touch with the language. However, I am making an effort to touch up on my command of the Spanish language using apps such as Duolingo and Rosetta Stone.
                    </p>
                 <h4>Malayalam:</h4>
                     <p>
                        Malayalam is a language which is spoken in the state of Kerala, in the south of India. It is a language which is spoken by over 33 million people. The language is not confined to the borders of Kerala, but is spread out all over the world, due to the 'Keralite' diaspora. As someone who is a member of this diaspora, I also have a high level of expertise in Malayalam.
