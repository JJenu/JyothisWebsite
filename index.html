                Hello, my name is Jyothis Jenu. I was born on 04/01/2002. I recently finished second year engineering at Trinity College Dublin.

                As we all know, a resum√© is only one or two pages long, which makes it almost impossible to know who a person really is just by reading it. As such, I made this basic website so that potential employers or other interested parties can check out who I am and what I do.
